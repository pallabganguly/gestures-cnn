# Gesture Classification using CNN
## Still under development
## Repository of code and results for gesture classification using CNN for UG Project ![computervision/tensorflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/computervision-tensorflow-yellow.svg)
Source code for Under Graduate Project, on recogntition and classification of static gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## How to install:
It is highly recommended to crate a virtual environment with python3 before proceeding with the installation
* Manually install OpenCV 3.1.0
* git clone https://github.com/pallabganguly/gestures-cnn.git
* cd gestures-cnn/
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* python finalgest.py

Download the trained model from:
Keep the model in a directory called tfmodels, which is in a directory separate from src.
Run python finalgest.py
